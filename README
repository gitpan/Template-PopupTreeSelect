Template::PopupTreeSelect version 0.9
=====================================

This module is a subclass of HTML::PopupTreeSelect by Sam Tregar.
It uses Template-Toolkit rather than HTML::Template.

This module creates an HTML popup tree selector.  The HTML and
Javascript produced will work in Mozilla 1+ (Netscape 6+) on all
operating systems, Microsoft IE 5+ and Safari 1.0.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then copy the images from HTML::PopupTreeSelect in images/ into a
place here your web server can find them.  Remember where you put them
so you'll know what value to set for image_path when you call new().


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  HTML::PopupTreeSelect 1.4
  Template 2.08
  Test::More
  Carp


CONTRIBUTORS

My initial version was a modified copy of HTML::PopupTreeSelect by Sam
Tregar.  Chris Nandor modified it to subclass instead of replace it.
